- About Me Section: About Me: Include a concise biography, skills (presented visually with icons or badges), and a prominent link to download the resume.
- Projects Showcase: Projects Section: Showcase at least three featured projects, with each entry including a title, a succinct description, a list of the tech stack, and direct links to both the GitHub repository and a live demo (if available).
- Experience Section: Experience Timeline: Clearly present professional experience using a timeline or list format, detailing roles, employers, and employment dates.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 50%, 50%) which converts to a vibrant shade of blue, #4680FF, suggestive of technology.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 20%) which converts to a dark blue-gray, #33394D, to support a dark color scheme, while harmonizing with the primary.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 60%) which converts to a bright cyan, #4DD1FF, used for highlighting interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body text: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif.
- Headline text: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif. NOTE: 'Space Grotesk' paired with 'Inter' would be good for headlines and short descriptions. 'Inter' on it's own could work too, but might look a little flat or boring.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Simple line icons for skills, contact info, and other key elements to maintain a clean, modern aesthetic.
- A mobile-first, responsive layout with a clean, grid-based structure to ensure readability and easy navigation on all devices.
- Subtle fade-in and slide-in animations on content load and scroll to create a smooth and engaging user experience.
